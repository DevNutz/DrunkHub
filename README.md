## Running
To use the built-in Android-Studio emulator, you'll need to add the `local.properties` file in the root project directory:

    # local.properties
    # Location of the SDK. This is only used by Gradle.
    sdk.dir=/home/YOURUSERNAME/Android/Sdk
    # Or specify the Android SDK path in your system.
